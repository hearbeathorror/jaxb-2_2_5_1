  This API is designed for the use by the JAX-RPC runtime. The API is is subject to
  change without notice.

  <p>
  In an container environment, such as in J2SE/J2EE, if a new version with
  a modified runtime API is loaded into a child class loader, it will still be bound
  against the old runtime API in the base class loader.

  <p>
  So the compatibility of this API has to be managed carefully.
