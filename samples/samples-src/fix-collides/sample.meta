        Another binding customization example that illustrates how to resolve 
        name conflicts. Run "ant fail" first to see the compiler output and 
        then look at binding.xjb to see how the errors were resolved. Running 
        "ant" will use the binding customizations to resolve the name conflicts 
        while compiling the schema.
