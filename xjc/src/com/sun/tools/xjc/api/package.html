API for programatic invocation of XJC.

<p>
This package provides a way to invoke XJC from within another program.
The primarily target of this API is the JAX-RPC RI, but we hope that
this API would be useful for other integration purposes as well.

<p>
This package shouldn't contain any implementation code.
