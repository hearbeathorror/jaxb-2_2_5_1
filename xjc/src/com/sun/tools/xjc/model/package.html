  Implementation of the <code>com.sun.xml.bind.j2s.model</code> package for XJC.


  <p>
  This model is the recipes for the code generation.
  It captures the essence of the JAXB-bound beans,
  so that the actual Java code can be generated from this object model
  mechanically without knowing anything about how the model was built.

  <p>
  Classes that implement model interfaces are prefixed with 'C', which stands for
  'Compiler'. A suggestion for better names are always welcome.
