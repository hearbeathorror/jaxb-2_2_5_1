<p>
	The core model contract is parameterized so that it can be used with different reflection libraries. This portion is used by all three running mode of JAXB. The corresponding implementaion is also parameterized.
<p>
	The runtime model contract and implementation are used only t the run-time. These packages fix the parameterization to the Java reflection, and also exposes additional functionalities to actually do the unmarshalling/marshalling. These classes have "Runtime" prefix.
<p>
	Finally XJC has its own implementation of the contract in its own package. This package also fixes the parameterization to its own reflection library.
<p>
	When you work on the code, it is often helpful to know the layer you are in.


<h1>Model</h1>
<p>
	The binding model roughly looks like the following.
