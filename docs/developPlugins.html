      This document describes how to write an XJC plugin to extend the code generation of XJC.
    </p><p>
    
    <h2>What Can A Plugin Do?</h2>
    <p>
      An XJC plugin participates in the code generation from a schema. It can define its own customizations that users can use to control it, it can access the code that the JAXB RI generates, it can generate additional classes/methods/fields/annotations/comments, and it can also replace some of the pluggability points in the compilation process, such as XML name -> Java name conversion.
    </p><p>
      As a show case of what a plugin can do, take a look at <a href="http://jaxb2-commons.java.net/">plugins hosted at JAXB2-commons</a>.
    </p>
    
    
    <h3>Quick Start</h3>
    <p>
      To write a plugin, do the following simple steps.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Write a class, say, <tt>org.acme.MyPlugin</tt> by extending <tt>com.sun.tools.xjc.Plugin</tt>. See javadoc for how to implement methods.
      <li>Write the name of your plugin class in a text file and put it as <tt>/META-INF/services/com.sun.tools.xjc.Plugin</tt> in your jar file.
    </ol>
    <p>
      Users can then use your plugins by declaring an XJC ant task with your jar files.
    </p>
<pre><xmp>
<taskdef name="xjc" classname="com.sun.tools.xjc.XJCTask">
  <classpath>
    <fileset dir="jaxb-ri/lib" includes="*.jar" />
    <fileset dir="your-plugin" includes="*.jar" />
  </classpath>
</taskdef>
</xmp></pre>
    
    <h3>Resources</h3>
    <p>
    	See <a href="http://jaxb.java.net/plugin.html">this page</a> for more detailed, up-to-date information. 
    <p>
      Although we will do our best to maintain the compatibility of the interfaces, it is still subject to change at this point.
