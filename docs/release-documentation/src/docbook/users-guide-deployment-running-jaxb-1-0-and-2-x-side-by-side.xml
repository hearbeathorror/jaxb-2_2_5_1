    <title>Running JAXB 1.0 and 2.x side by side</title>

    <para>You can always run an application X that uses JAXB 1.0 and another
    application Y that uses JAXB 2.x side by side, in the same classloader. To
    do this, remove the runtime jars from JAXB 1.0 from X, and instead use
    <filename>jaxb-impl.jar</filename> and <filename>jaxb1-mpl.jar</filename> from JAXB 2.0.x.
    Those two jars are designed to be compatible with earlier 1.0 versions of
    the runtime.</para>

    <para>When you have a runtime from 1.0 in your classpath before 2.0.x, a
    user reported that you'll get <literal>java.lang.NoSuchMethodError:
    com.sun.xml.bind.WhiteSpaceProcessor.isWhiteSpace(Ljava/lang/CharSequence;)Z</literal>.
    Starting with JAXB 2.1.6 the runtime will diagnose this error nicely, but
    if you are using earlier versions, check your classpath.</para>
